**About RevRise Media:**  
RevRise Media is a fast-growing tech-enabled insurance marketing company based in San Diego. We help businesses and insurance brands accelerate their growth through innovative marketing strategies and technology solutions.

**About this Role:**  
We are looking for a Staff Data Platform Engineer to own the critical data layers that power our applications and downstream analytics. The ideal candidate will be able to understand development project scope and requirements and work ahead of the development team with the goal of abstracting away database complexity and migration orchestration as a bottleneck to feature delivery. With deep SQL expertise and production database experience, you’ll be responsible for developing and maintaining our PostgreSQL infrastructure while ensuring zero-downtime deployments. Beyond the application, you’ll leverage your deep understanding of our data to assist our analytics team in expanding our data lake and transforming our data for deep analysis using DBT and BigQuery.

**Responsibilities:**

* **Lead schema design and architecture** for new features, working 1-2 sprints ahead of the development team to ensure database readiness.  
* **Own end-to-end migration pipeline** using Sqitch, from development through production deployment with zero-downtime execution.  
* **Design and maintain database abstractions** (views, stored procedures, functions) that simplify application code and improve developer velocity.  
* **Build and optimize the reporting layer** in PostgreSQL to power real-time dashboards and business intelligence needs.  
* **Transform application data for analytics** using DBT and BigQuery, creating reusable models that enable deep analytics.  
* **Ensure data quality and consistency** across all pipelines through automated testing, monitoring, and validation frameworks.  
* **Performance tune critical queries and indexes**, maintaining sub-second response times as data volumes scales.  
* **Establish data governance standards** including documentation, naming conventions, and change management processes.  
* **Collaborate cross-functionally** with engineering teams on requirements and analytics teams on data modeling needs.  
* **Mentor developers on database best practices** and provide technical guidance during code reviews for data-touching features.

**Qualifications and Skills:**

* **7+ years of production database engineering experience** with a track record of managing complex schemas at scale.  
* **Expert-level SQL proficiency** across multiple dialects with deep PostgreSQL expertise including advanced features (CTEs, window functions, JSON operations).  
* **Production migration experience** with schema versioning tools (Sqitch strongly preferred, or similar tools like Flyway/Liquibase).  
* **Proven ability to design scalable database architectures** supporting high-throughput transactional systems (100K+ daily transactions).  
* **Experience with analytics engineering** including dimensional modeling, ETL/ELT patterns, and modern transformation tools (DBT preferred).  
* **BigQuery or similar cloud data warehouse expertise** with understanding of columnar storage optimization and cost management.  
* **Strong software engineering fundamentals** including version control, code review processes, and CI/CD for database changes.  
* **Track record of cross-functional collaboration**, translating business requirements into technical implementations.  
* **Excellent troubleshooting skills** with experience diagnosing and resolving production database issues under pressure.  
* **Clear technical communication** with ability to document complex systems and mentor team members on database best practices.

**Benefits:**

* **Fully Remote** \- Flexible hours that respect your work/life balance.  
* **Premium Health Coverage** \- Company contribution to health, dental, and vision insurance (our business is health insurance\!).  
* **Industry-Leading 401(k)** \- 6% company match with no vesting period.  
* **Team Gatherings** \- All expenses paid team events to connect with your team in person (flights, hotels, meals covered).
